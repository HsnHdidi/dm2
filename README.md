Pneumonia Detection — Project README

Overview

This project performs binary classification of pediatric chest X-ray images (PNEUMONIA vs NORMAL). The notebook `project.ipynb` documents preprocessing, dataset cleaning, and dataset preparation steps used for experiments.

Preprocessing steps performed (recorded):

1. Collected images from the original `chest_xray` dataset (train/val/test) and copied them into a combined folder: `chest_xray_combined/NORMAL` and `.../PNEUMONIA`.
2. Inspected image modes and sizes. Identified 283 RGB images and 76 images with any dimension <= 299 in the combined folder.
3. Per project decision, images not meeting criteria were removed (RGB-mode images removed first). After removal, the combined folder contains only grayscale images (`L` mode) and has 5573 images.
4. Created resized datasets at 299x299:
   - `chest_xray_299` — converted to RGB and resized for transfer-learning compatibility (EfficientNet, ResNet, etc.).
   - `chest_xray_299_gray` — resized single-channel (`L`) versions for grayscale experiments.
5. Created normalized datasets (pixel values in [0,1]) saved as per-image `.npy` files:
   - `chest_xray_299_norm` — RGB images as float32 arrays (H, W, 3)
   - `chest_xray_299_gray_norm` — grayscale images as float32 arrays (H, W)

Files / folders created

- `chest_xray_combined/` — cleaned combined dataset (post-removal)
- `chest_xray_299/` — resized RGB images (299x299)
- `chest_xray_299_gray/` — resized grayscale images (299x299)
- `chest_xray_299_norm/` — normalized `.npy` RGB arrays
- `chest_xray_299_gray_norm/` — normalized `.npy` grayscale arrays
- `project.ipynb` — main notebook with preprocessing steps, verification cells and generation code

Recommendations / next steps

- Use `chest_xray_299` for transfer-learning experiments with pretrained backbones (RGB input expected).
- Use `chest_xray_299_gray` or the `.npy` normalized arrays for grayscale-only experiments or when training from scratch.
- Keep manifests (`manifest_rgb.csv`, `manifest_gray.csv`) for reproducibility; use them to track filenames, labels and checksums if required.
- Add augmentation pipelines, experiment tracking (CSV/MLflow), and a training scaffold (TensorFlow/PyTorch) with early stopping and class weighting.
