put all images in one folder (DONE)
Assure all images are 2 channels. (if not, count the not, if very few, remove them) (DONE)
count the images where size is <=299, if very few remove them (DONE)
downsize all to 299x299 (DONE)
0-255 --> [0,1]


Now initial preprocessing done. 
We need to consider:
 - integration OR Augmentatino
 - Best Ensemble methods

Our goal is best accuracy without overfitting.
